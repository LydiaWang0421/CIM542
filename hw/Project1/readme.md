# Peaceful Sea Vibe

  This project is to show a peaceful sea vibe. It contains two beacons and a small boat.

## Why This Project
  When people think about the sea, they usually have two kinds of feelings: one is calm, and another is dangerous. Since this scene has two beacons with light, the sea is bright and gives people a sense of safety.

  Imagine you are lying down on a small boat on the sea with the reflection of light on your face, you can feel the peace in your heart.

## Equipment

* 4 LEDs

  1 Squar Box (as the sea), 
  2 Polygonal-based Pyramid (as the white walls of the beacons),
