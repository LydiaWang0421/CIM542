# Peaceful Sea Vibe

  This project is to show a peaceful sea vibe. It contains two beacons and a small boat.


## Why This Project
  When people think about the sea, they usually have two kinds of feelings: one is calm, and another is dangerous. Since this scene has two beacons with lights, the sea is bright and gives people a sense of safety.

  Imagine you are lying down on a small boat on the sea with the reflection of light on your face, you can feel the peace in your heart.


## Equipment
* Arduino Uno
* 4 LEDs
* Cricut:
  1 Square Box with Some Blue Papers (as the sea), 
  2 Polygonal-based Pyramid (as the white walls of the beacons), 
  2 Cones (as the windows of the beacons), 
* A Small Hand-made Boat
* Some Drawings (as the sea waves)


## Code Plan
*  When pressing the button the first time, all of the four lights turn on. 
  
*  When pressing the button again, all of the four lights start blinking. 
  Sequence: the lights on the beacon start blinking, and then turn off
  And then the lights on the boats start blinking, and then turn off
  
*  When pressing the button again, all of the four lights turn off.

## The Process
  When I first start doing this project, I chose the emotion "peaceful." Then, I began to think about the objects I need to include in this project. 
  
  Listening to the Professor's suggestions, I decided to use the transparent paper outside of the lights to show the lights from the beacons. 
  
  Then, after printing the beacons, I realized that the size of my boat was not calculated correctly. However, it was also challenging to make a much smaller boat corresponding to the actual size compared to the beacons. Also, when I was trying to connect the wires to my project, I found that the wires are too short to connect the breadboard and the paper sculpture. So, I soldered the wires and LEDs again to make it the right length. This is the thing I need to focus on next time when beginning the first draft.
