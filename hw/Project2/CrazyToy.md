# Crazy Toy

  This project is to create a Crazy Toy with LEDs. 


## Why This Project
  The purpose of this project is to create a red Crazy Toy for anyone to play with. 
  This is a sound-control toy with LEDs blinking from eyes and mouth, so the users can make some noise to see the changes of the LEDs. This shows how the sound reacts with the users' voice interactions. 


## Equipment
Tinkercad - Circuits
 * Arduino Uno
 * 3 LEDs
 * a button
 * a potentiometer
 
Onshape
 * the body of the toy
 
Tinkercad - 3D Design
 * a cylinder
 * 2 eyes
 * a mouth
 * a hat
 

## Input and Output
* Input: sound (potentiometer)
* Output: LEDs


## Code Plan
* When clicking the button behind the toy, the toy will turn on and start detecting sounds. 

* The potentiometer is used to emulate the amount of sound. 

* The users can create any kind of noise, like clapping the hand, shouting out loud, knocking the desk, and so on, to make the toy becomes alive. 

* When the sound reaches a certain amount, the users can notice the changes in the LEDs. The LEDs would be brighter when the sound is louder.
